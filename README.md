Ephemeral DAO Contract

Overview

The Ephemeral DAO is a Clarity smart contract that represents a temporary decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to exist only until it achieves a single specific goal. Once the goal is met—or if all members unanimously vote to dissolve—the DAO self-destructs (auto-dissolves) and can no longer be interacted with.

This design models organizations with finite lifespans, ensuring decentralization, goal-oriented collaboration, and graceful exit without perpetual governance overhead.

⚙️ Core Features
Feature	Description
Initialization	The contract owner initializes the DAO with a name and a clear goal statement.
Membership	Users can join and leave the DAO anytime before it dissolves.
Voting on Goal Achievement	Members vote to confirm the goal has been achieved. Once a majority is reached, the DAO auto-dissolves.
Emergency Dissolution	Members can unanimously vote to dissolve the DAO early for any reason.
Auto-Dissolution	When the goal is achieved or all members vote for dissolution, the contract marks itself inactive and stores the block height of dissolution.
Read-only Queries	Members can fetch DAO information such as name, goal, membership status, vote counts, and dissolution height.

🧠 Conceptual Design

The DAO’s lifecycle is straightforward:

Creation:
The contract owner initializes the DAO with a name and purpose.
→ Example: “Build a community-driven dApp.”

Participation:
Members join the DAO to collaborate and vote on achieving the goal.

Voting:

Members vote “goal achieved.”

If majority votes are reached → DAO auto-dissolves.

Alternatively, if all members vote for dissolution → DAO dissolves immediately.

Dissolution:
Once dissolved, no further joins, votes, or changes can occur.
The block height of dissolution is stored permanently for transparency.

🔐 Error Codes
Code	Meaning
u100	Not a member
u101	Already a member
u102	DAO is already dissolved
u103	Goal not yet achieved
u104	Insufficient votes
u105	Already voted
u400	DAO already initialized
u401	Invalid DAO name
u402	Invalid goal description
u403	Only owner can initialize

🔍 Read-Only Functions
Function	Description
(get-dao-info)	Returns DAO metadata and status.
(is-member member)	Checks if an address is a member.
(has-voted-goal member)	Checks if a member voted for goal completion.

🧪 Example Flow

Initialize the DAO

(contract-call? .ephemeral-dao initialize-dao "Mission DAO" "Launch decentralized educational platform")


Join as a Member

(contract-call? .ephemeral-dao join-dao)


Vote that Goal is Achieved

(contract-call? .ephemeral-dao vote-goal-achieved)


Check DAO Info

(contract-call? .ephemeral-dao get-dao-info)


DAO Auto-Dissolves
Once majority votes are reached, all subsequent actions return ERR_DAO_DISSOLVED.

🏁 Key Design Philosophy
“A DAO that knows when to end.”
The Ephemeral DAO embodies the idea that not all DAOs need to last forever.
By dissolving after achieving its purpose, it promotes efficiency, accountability, and clarity of mission.
